<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">âœ¨ I'm currently working on a unique application designed to assist individuals at a beginner level in learning and practicing their Arabic vocabulary. This project was inspired by my own experiences and those of my classmates, as we are all taking Arabic lessons as a hobby. The application focuses on interactive learning methods to enhance memory and retention of vocabulary.<br>ðŸ“š I am currently deepening my expertise in Java development by learning advanced concepts in Spring Framework. My immediate goal is to apply these advanced Spring capabilities to the Arabic language learning application I previously mentioned.<br>ðŸŽ¯ Goals: My next goal is absolutely mastering Angular and Kubernetes, and to enhance my web design skills. I am committed to deepening my expertise to create more dynamic and responsive web applications.<br>ðŸŽ² Fun fact: I initially embarked on a journey in graphic design, which led to a surprising discovery. While exploring the realms of design, I found that my true passion lay not in drawing, but in coding. Life is truly unpredictable sometimes.</p>
